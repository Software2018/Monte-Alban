        <h3> Here's a few things about Monte Alban:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1</strong> - As indicated by Blanton's survey of the site, the Monte Albán hills appear to have been uninhabited prior to 500 BCE (the end of the Rosario ceramic phase)</li>
          <li><strong>2</strong> - At that time, San José Mogote was the major population center in the valley and head of a chiefdom that likely controlled much of the northern Etla branch.</li>
          <li><strong>3</strong> - Perhaps as many as three or four other smaller chiefly centers controlled other sub-regions of the valley, including Tilcajete in the southern Valle Grande branch and Yegüih in the Tlacolula arm to the east.</li>

        </ul>
